Creates a search widget to allow you to search single/multiple post types

== Description ==

WPS Post Type Search creates a simple search widget that allows users to predefine the post types they wish to search via checkboxes. This widget adds no additional styling or javascript to your site leaving you in full control. In the widget settings, you choose from the public post types that you would like users to be able to search. If none are selected, the search widget defaults to just posts (and not pages).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `wps-post-type-search` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the widget via Appearance > Widgets
